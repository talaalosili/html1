<p>The Jews who descended from Abraham were never really the nation we associate with greatness.  They did not conquer and build a great empire 
    like the Romans did or build large monuments like the Egyptians did with the pyramids. Their fame comes from the Law and Book which they wrote; from some remarkable individuals that were Jewish; and that they have survived as a somewhat different people group for thousands of years.  Their greatness is not because of anything they did, but rather what was done to and through them.  The promise says repeatedly “I will …” – that would be the power behind the promise.  Their unique greatness happened because God made it happen rather than some ability, conquest or power of their own.
     The promise to Abraham came true because he trusted a promise and chose to live differently than others. Think how likely it was for this
     promise to have failed, but instead it has happened, and is continuing to unfold, as it was stated  thousands of years ago.  The case is
      strong that the promise came true only because of the power and authority of the Promise-Maker. </p>
     
     <p>  Hello there! Nice to see you! My name is Adam Smith. I am 17 and an student in high school. I am planning to go college in New York. My courses in high school are Biology, Spanish, and History. Spanish is the hardest course I have been taking until now. It’s my second year in school now. I love my school.
 I live in a big house in Amsterdam. It’s close to the my high school. I share my house with two different students. Their names are Bill  and Paul. We love to help each other with schoolwork. Toward the end of the week, we play football.
I have a more youthful brother. He just began secondary school. He is 13 and lives with my parents. They live on Acardan Street
 in Amsterdam. Sometimes they call me and visit me in Amsterdam. I am very when they visit. My mom always brings me desserts and candy 
         when they come. I miss them so much, as well!</p>

<p><mark> coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs</mark>, that computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.<u> Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic</u>.

    Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall process – with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se.<mark> Sometimes software development is known as software engineering</mark>, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process.</p>

<p>Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[3][4] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, 
    via pegs and cams.[5][6] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.[7]
     The first computer program is generally dated to 1843 when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.[8]
     Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.
    In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[9] Later a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory  </p>

<p>Quartz is our most common mineral. Quartz is made of the two most abundant chemical elements on Earth: oxygen anı silicon. Atoms of oxygen and silicon join together as tetrahedrons (three sided pyramids). These stack together to build crystals. Billions of tetrahedrons are needed to build even a small crystal. </p>

<h3>Review:Basketball Dog (2018)</h3>
<img src="dog.jpg"width="300"height="200"><br>
<i>4 out of 5 stars</i><br>
<p>From director<b> Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.
 <br> <br>This movie has everything you could ask for:</p>
  <li>Basketball</li>
  <li> A dog</li>
  <li> Nail-biting suspense</li>
<p>While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears.
